# inventory-application

Hands-on experimentation with backend development using Node.js with the Express framework.

Working through The Odin Project and applying what I learnt with each project.

# Project Goals

- Set up an express server.
- Set up a database using PosgreSQL.
- Connect the express server to the database.
- Create a game management app with the following entities:
  - game
  - genre
  - developer
- Set up routes and controllers.
- Add functionality to add and update games in the database.
- Figure out how to add the ability to delete a game or a category of games.
- Deploy the app to a service provider.
- Add basic authentication using LocalStrategy from `passport-local`.
- Use Prisma ORM for all database operations.
